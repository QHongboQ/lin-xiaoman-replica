"""Backup helpers: consistent SQLite snapshots for the zip archive.

Why this module exists
----------------------
``quill_wr.db`` / ``quill_memory.db`` / ``quill_rag.db`` all run in WAL mode
(see ``kb.py`` / ``quill_rag/*.py``).  In WAL mode a ``.db`` file on disk is
*not* the whole database: transactions committed since the last checkpoint
live only in the ``-wal`` sidecar.  Copying the live ``.db`` bytes therefore
captures a stale snapshot — a hot backup can read 0 rows even though the
running process has committed rows.

The archive deliberately does **not** ship ``-wal`` / ``-shm``: replaying a
sidecar captured at a different instant over a restored main file is worse
than not shipping it at all.  Instead each ``.db`` file is replaced by a
snapshot taken through SQLite's online backup API, which merges the main file
and the WAL into one self-contained, transactionally consistent database.

Pure standard library on purpose: importable (and unit-testable) without
AstrBot or aiosqlite installed.
